REPLACER.TSV is a Tab-Separated Values file.
It can be loaded into most office programs.

Include file extensions in the file path.
Relative file paths (those that do not start with drive letters)
start from the Aircraft folder.

In the FIRST column, choose the file you want to CLEAR.
In the SECOND column, choose the file you want to COPY OVER.

Separate each column with a tab character.
(If you use an office program, it will format the TSV for you)

Example:

__aiPlaneFile__.xml	MyPlane.xml
__aiPlaneFile2__.xml	C:\\Users\Username\My Plane 2.xml
